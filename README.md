# Flask Hello World Application

## Description
This is a simple Flask web application that returns a "Hello World" message. It's designed to demonstrate a basic Flask setup, routing, and running a server.

## Features
- Basic Flask setup and routing.
- Simple GET request response.
- Runs in debug mode for easy testing and development.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Flask and Python

## Requirements
- Install Flask by running:
  ```bash
  pip install Flask
  ```

## Running the Program
1. **Clone the repository** or save the script to a local `.py` file.
2. **Install Flask** (if not already installed).
3. **Run the application** with the following command:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (by default in debug mode).

## Using the Program

### Sample Input and Output

**Note:** Be sure to correct your code to avoid syntax errors. Here's an updated version:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

appname = Flask(__name__)

@appname.route("/")
def hello():
    return "hello world"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    appname.run(debug=True)
```

This updated code fixes the indentation for `appname.run(debug=True)`, making it ready to run smoothly.
